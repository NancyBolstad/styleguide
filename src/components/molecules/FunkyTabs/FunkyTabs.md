    The FunkyTabs component are implemented as a list, where each tab is a list element with a link inside.
    The link has a href; <code>&lt;a href=""&gt;</code>, with the intention that the href also is a part of the URL.
</p>
<p>
    When a new tab is clicked, the content in the panel associated with the tab should be displayed, and the URL
    changes to indicate to the user that he/she are looking at some new content.
